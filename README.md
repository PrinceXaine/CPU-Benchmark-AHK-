# How to Use
- To use, just choose how many threads you would like to use, then click "Start Benchmark".
- To opt out of the multi-threading test, simply reduce the # of Threads to 1.
- The test will lock your mouse.
- The test will automatically complete in ~20 seconds.

# Results
- The script will dump the results, with a timestamp, into whatever directory it is in.
- You only need ensure that you have write access to the directory.

# Other Features
- Stress Test: Allows you to run a stress test for any length of time on your processor.
- High Priority: The program is built to run in high-priority. This offers consistent results.

# Future Updates
- Include timer for stress test.
- Include Real-Time option.

# Will not include
- This program is stand-alone. I will not be including temperature sensors as AHK does not support it.
  If you wish to monitor temps, you will need to utilize a third-party application.
